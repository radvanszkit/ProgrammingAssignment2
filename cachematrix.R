## The following functions calculate and cache the inverse of a matrix as follows:
## 1. makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## 2. cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to
## 1. set the value of the matrix
## 2. get the value of the matrix
## 3. set the value of the inverse
## 4. get the value of the inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
    getinverse <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
          setinverse = setinverse,
          getinverse = getinverse)
}


## The cacheSolve function calculates the mean of the special "matrix" created with the makeCacheMatrix function.
## It first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    m <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
}
